## Documentation

Please also take a look at `man shutdown`, since this module is just a wrapper around the Unix `shutdown` command (which may vary slightly).

### shutdown([time, message])

Shuts down the local computer.

* `time` {String} the time at which shutdown will bring the system down and may be the word now (indicating an immediate shutdown) or specify a future time in one of two formats: +number, or yymmddhhmm, where the year, month, and day may be defaulted to the current system values. The first form brings the system down in number minutes and the second at the absolute time specified.
* `message` {String} warning message that is broadcast to users currently logged into the system.

### reboot([time, message])

Reboots after shutdown.

* `time` {String} the time at which shutdown will bring the system down and may be the word now (indicating an immediate shutdown) or specify a future time in one of two formats: +number, or yymmddhhmm, where the year, month, and day may be defaulted to the current system values. The first form brings the system down in number minutes and the second at the absolute time specified.
* `message` {String} warning message that is broadcast to users currently logged into the system.

### abort()

* `message` {String} warning message that is broadcast to users currently logged into the system.

Aborts shutdown / logoff / reboot.
